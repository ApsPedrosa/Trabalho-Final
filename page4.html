        Sla mano, tipo, um texto?

        Love and Hate 

        Complex subject right? I feel like life it is, I wrote an poem today,
        and would like to trancript it here, it's not quite a poem, but a
        conversation, tho the way I wrote looks like a poem, but it won't here.
        
        
        
                Why?
            
            Why?
            Why what?
            Why like this?
            Tired.
            Of what?
            Almost everything, thus, in love with it all.
            It all what?
            Studies, life, people...
            Why tho?
            Why what?
            Why so sad?
            Well...
            Proceed, please.
            Life is annoying, with people telling you what to do, subjects that are hard
        because you got so much preasure and stress in your back, you can't learn, and you
        still use a lot of time learning, because you want...
            And what is good?
            The same things... people and studies and life, but not the same ones, the
        people I miss even if I don't talk to them for one day, the studies I want to study, but 
        can't, because of time, or other things. And life... it's lovely.
            So everything is Love and Hell?
            Sort of...
            You are very contradictory.
            Just like Life...
